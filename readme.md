# Playlist Manager
Our application allows users to create, save, share, and manage playlists effectively.

# Basic Features:
Load a CSV with songs and convert them into Song objects.
Provide a user interface with options to create a new playlist or select an existing one.
Allow users to add songs to their playlist.
Enable undo and redo functionalities to rectify accidental additions to the playlist.
Allow users to display available songs for selection.
Provide a feature to showcase the contents of the playlist.
Enable users to save their playlist for future reference.
Implement a sharing option, allowing users to generate a text file with the playlist name and all the songs.

# Follow the Prompts:
The prompts will guide users through the application's workflow.
Users must create a playlist first or select an existing one.
Subsequently, they can add songs based on the index or name from the CSV file, with the option to choose the insertion point in the playlist.
Repeat the process until satisfied, then save the playlist following the prompt.
To undo or redo an action, users can type "redo" or "undo."
The sharing option allows users to generate a file with information about their playlist.

# Create Another Playlist:
Users can create additional playlists by returning to the main menu and repeating the steps.
